#summary Overview of feed directory structure

= Feed Directory Structure =

|| download || Where inbound feeds should be downloaded or created. ||
|| failed || Where feeds are moved to when a feed fails to complete processing. || 
|| incoming || Where inbound feeds should be moved to once ready for processing. ||
|| original || Where the original version of a feed file should be moved to. ||
|| preprocess || Where feeds are prepared for incoming (i.e. Unzipping a feed file). ||
|| rejected || Where feeds are moved to when they fail and are rejected. ||
|| temp || Where temporary files are built and destroyed during feed processing. ||
|| workarea || Where the feed files are moved when they are being processed. ||

|| *Name* || *Description* || 
|| archive || Where feeds may be moved once removed from outgoing. ||
