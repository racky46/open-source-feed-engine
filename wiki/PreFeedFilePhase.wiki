= Basic Code Logic =
The basic logic for preFeedFilePhase processing is defined below.
{{{
  protected void runPreFeedFilePhases() {
    final List<Phase> phases = context.getPreFeedFilePhases();

    for (Phase phase : phases) {
      context.setCurrentPhaseId(phase.getName());
      phase.initialize();
      phase.execute();
    }
  }
}}}
