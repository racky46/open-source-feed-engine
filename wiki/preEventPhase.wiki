= Basic Code Logic =
The basic logic for preEventPhase processing is defined below.
{{{
  private void doPreEventPhases() {
    final List<Phase> phases = context.getPreEventPhases();

    for (Phase phase : phases) {
      context.setCurrentPhaseId(phase.getName());
      feedJobManager.startPhaseStats(phase, context);
      phase.initialize();
      phase.execute();
      feedJobManager.endPhaseStats(phase,context);
    }
  }
