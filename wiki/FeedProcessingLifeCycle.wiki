= Example Processing Life Cycle Scenarios = 

 # [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedEngineLifeCycleExampleI Scenario I]  - a feed file is failed twice and then rejected.
 # [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedEngineLifeCycleExampleII Scenario II] - a feed file is successfully completed.
