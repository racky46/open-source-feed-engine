#summary Overview of feed processing life cycle

= Feed Processing Life Cycle =

The feed processing life cycle is the defined as the set of one or more [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedJobLifeCycle feed job life cycles] associated to  a given [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedFileLifeCycle feed file life cycle] use to process a given feed file to either a successful completion or rejection of the feed file as permanently failed.

= Example Processing Life Cycle Scenarios = 
The examples scenarios below show the state transitions of the feedFile, feedJob and movement of the feed file to the appropriate directory.

 # [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedEngineLifeCycleExampleI Scenario I]  - a feed file is failed twice and then rejected.
 # [http://code.google.com/p/open-source-feed-engine/wiki/FeedEngineLifeCycleExampleII Scenario II] - a feed file is successfully completed. 

= Feed Processing Life Cycle State Diagram =

The diagram defines the combined states of the feed file and feed a given feed job during the feed file life cycle.
