= Feed File Life Cycle States =
During the feed file life cycle, a feed file may transition between one of five states:

 * processing
 * completed
 * failed
 * retry
 * rejected
 
= processing =
The 'processing' state specifies that the feed engine is currently processing the feed.  The 'processing' state is the initial state of a given feed file life cycle.

= completed =
The 'completed' state specifies that the feed engine has successfully completed processing the feed.

= failed = 
The 'failed' state specifies that the feed engine failed to successfully complete processing the feed.

= retry =
The 'retry' state specifies that the feed, which was in a failed state, has been repaired and another attempt should be may to process the feed.

= rejected = 
The 'rejected' state specifies that feed, which was in a failed state, cannot be successfully processed and has been permanently rejected.
